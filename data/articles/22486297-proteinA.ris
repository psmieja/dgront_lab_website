TI  - From coarse-grained to atomic-level characterization of protein dynamics: 
      transition state for the folding of B domain of protein A.

AB  - Atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations are widely used for the 
      characterization of the structural dynamics of proteins; however, they are 
      limited to shorter time scales than the duration of most of the relevant 
      biological processes. Properly designed coarse-grained models that trade atomic 
      resolution for efficient sampling allow access to much longer time-scales. 
      In-depth understanding of the structural dynamics, however, must involve atomic 
      details. In this study, we tested a method for the rapid reconstruction of 
      all-atom models from Î± carbon atom positions in the application to convert a 
      coarse-grained folding trajectory of a well described model system: the B domain 
      of protein A. The results show that the method and the spatial resolution of the 
      resulting coarse-grained models enable computationally inexpensive reconstruction 
      of realistic all-atom models. Additionally, by means of structural clustering, we 
      determined the most persistent ensembles of the key folding step, the transition 
      state. Importantly, the analysis of the overall structural topologies suggests a 
      dominant folding pathway. This, together with the all-atom characterization of 
      the obtained ensembles, in the form of contact maps, matches the experimental 
      results well.
