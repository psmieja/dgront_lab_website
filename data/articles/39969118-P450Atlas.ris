AB  - Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs/P450s) are heme-containing enzymes known to 
      biology for more than six decades. Their stereo- and regio-specific enzymatic 
      activities on various compounds led to exploring their potential in almost all 
      areas of life. The P450 superfamily, encompassing nearly 10,000 known families, 
      boasts a staggering diversity represented by numerous families, highlighting its 
      immense scale within the realm of enzymes. In this contribution, we describe the 
      P450Atlas website: the ultimate source of information about all named P450 
      families and subfamilies. The website's main functionality is the automated 
      assignment of a query sequence to one of the known subfamilies. The new subfamily 
      assignment algorithm relies on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and has been 
      extensively tested and compared to an approach based on the BLAST program. 
      Extensive validation shows that the HMM approach is more sensitive than the 
      latter one, offering almost perfect automated P450 sequence assignment to 
      subfamilies. A user can also browse and search through the online list of 
      families across the Tree of Life. We believe that the P450Atlas website 
      (https://p450atlas.org) will become a comprehensive and unified source of 
      information on cytochrome 450 nomenclature.
