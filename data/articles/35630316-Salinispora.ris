TI  - An Unprecedented Number of Cytochrome P450s Are Involved in Secondary Metabolism 
      in Salinispora Species.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs/P450s) are heme thiolate proteins present in 
      species across the biological kingdoms. By virtue of their broad substrate 
      promiscuity and regio- and stereo-selectivity, these enzymes enhance or attribute 
      diversity to secondary metabolites. Actinomycetes species are well-known 
      producers of secondary metabolites, especially Salinispora species. Despite the 
      importance of P450s, a comprehensive comparative analysis of P450s and their role 
      in secondary metabolism in Salinispora species is not reported. We therefore 
      analyzed P450s in 126 strains from three different species Salinispora arenicola, 
      S. pacifica, and S. tropica. The study revealed the presence of 2643 P450s that 
      can be grouped into 45 families and 103 subfamilies. CYP107 and CYP125 families 
      are conserved, and CYP105 and CYP107 families are bloomed (a P450 family with 
      many members) across Salinispora species. Analysis of P450s that are part of 
      secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs) revealed Salinispora 
      species have an unprecedented number of P450s (1236 P450s-47%) part of smBGCs 
      compared to other bacterial species belonging to the genera Streptomyces (23%) 
      and Mycobacterium (11%), phyla Cyanobacteria (8%) and Firmicutes (18%) and the 
      classes Alphaproteobacteria (2%) and Gammaproteobacteria (18%). A peculiar 
      characteristic of up to six P450s in smBGCs was observed in Salinispora species. 
      Future characterization Salinispora species P450s and their smBGCs have the 
      potential for discovering novel secondary metabolites.
