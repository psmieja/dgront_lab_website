AB  - The mechanism through which nuclear receptors respond differentially to 
      structurally distinct agonists is a poorly understood process. We present a 
      computational method that identifies nuclear receptor amino acids that are likely 
      involved in biological responses triggered by ligand binding. The method involves 
      tracing how structural changes spread from the ligand binding pocket to the sites 
      on the receptor surface, which makes it a good tool for studying allosteric 
      effects. We employ the method to the vitamin D receptor and verify that the 
      identified amino acids are biologically relevant using a broad range of 
      experimental data and a genome browser. We infer that surface vitamin D receptor 
      residues K141, R252, I260, T280, T287 and L417 are likely involved in cell 
      differentiation and antiproliferation, whereas P122, D149, K321, E353 and Q385 
      are linked to carcinogenesis.
